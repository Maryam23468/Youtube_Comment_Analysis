## Purpose

The aim of this project is to automate the **analysis of YouTube comments** to:

- Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- Extract dominant emotions.
- Uncover key trends and comment patterns.
- Identify active communities and influential commenters.
- Provide visualization and data-driven metrics for decision-makers.


## Market Need

- **Brands \& Marketers:** Track public sentiment toward products, campaigns, or events in real-time.
- **Creators:** Gauge audience reactions, identify content strengths/weaknesses, and foster community.
- **Researchers \& Data Scientists:** Access an open framework for social media text mining.
- **Developers:** Integrate ready-to-use ML/DL pipelines into their applications or dashboards.


## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python 3
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- **NLP Libraries:** NLTK, TextBlob, VaderSentiment, NRCLex, langdetect
- **Deep Learning (for future extensions):** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (optional)
- **API:** Google API Python Client (for automatic comment fetching)
- **Visualization:** seaborn, matplotlib, wordcloud

## Analysis Sections

### 1. Data Cleaning \& Preprocessing

- Remove duplicates, missing values, and irrelevant comments.
- Normalize sentiment labels.
- Detect and flag languages to filter only relevant (e.g., English/targeted language) comments.


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Categorical and time-based distributions of comments.
- Most active users and comment word/character count statistics.
- Visualization of common words and wordclouds for positive comments.
- Comment trends over time and by author.


### 3. Sentiment Analysis

- **Rule-Based:** TextBlob, VaderSentiment for quick polarity detection.
- **Custom ML Model:** TfidfVectorizer + Logistic Regression trained on labeled data.
- **Evaluation:** Precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization.


### 4. Emotion Detection

- Use **NRCLex** to extract dominant comment emotions (joy, anger, sadness, etc.).
- Frequency analysis and bar charts of top comment emotions.


### 5. Language and Trend Analysis

- Detect comment languages (langdetect).
- Track comment frequency/minute to highlight trending periods.


### 6. Model Building \& Evaluation

- Data split into training and testing sets.
- Features extracted (TF-IDF).
- Model (e.g., Logistic Regression) trained and tested.
- Results summarized in a classification report.


## Future Improvements

- **Deep Learning:** Integrate LSTM, BERT, or transformer-based models for nuanced and multi-lingual sentiment/emotion detection.
- **Dashboard Integration:** Deploy web dashboards for real-time sentiment monitoring.
- **Automated Moderation:** Suggest helpful or harmful comments for community management.
- **Cross-Platform Analysis:** Extend analysis to Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok comments.


## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive, modular, and scalable framework for YouTube comment analysis using a blend of traditional ML and rule-based methods. It enables users to understand community sentiment, engagement, and emotions at scale, with a roadmap toward deep learning-powered, real-time, and multilingual capabilities.
